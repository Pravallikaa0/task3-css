      <p style="color:red";>
    A Smart CCTV system using Python is an intelligent video surveillance solution that integrates 
    computer vision and deep learning to monitor environments in real time. Using Python libraries 
    such as <strong>OpenCV</strong> for video capture and motion detection, <strong>NumPy</strong> 
    for frame processing, and <strong>YOLO, TensorFlow or PyTorch</strong> for object detection, the 
    system can automatically identify people, vehicles, or suspicious activities. With the help of 
    <strong>Flask or FastAPI</strong>, it can also provide a web dashboard for live streaming and 
    reviewing recorded events.

    Hardware requirements for such a system include IP cameras or webcams, an edge device like 
    Raspberry Pi or a GPU-enabled server for processing, and storage systems like local disks, 
    NAS, or cloud services for saving recordings. To ensure data safety, HTTPS, firewalls, and 
    encrypted credentials are used. Retention policies automatically clean up older footage, 
    ensuring the storage is efficiently managed.
